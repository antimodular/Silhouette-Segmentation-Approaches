# Silhouette Segmentation Approaches

The following is a practical comparison of various techniques of segmenting silhouettes/the general foreground from the background. It is intended as cursory research to inform which approach we use for extracting silhouettes for future installations. We will both compare based off specs/ collected data and share sample footage under various conditions. Important factors include: 

- Cost 
- Silhouette quality 
- multiple device support
- Ability to operate robustly under changing lighting conditions
- Range and FOV 
- Ease of development and Installation 
- Ability to deal with a variety lighting conditions

In general we explored two approaches: 

- Depth Camera: Using a depth camera then setting a 3D region of interest to extract the foreground. 
- Camera + Segmentation: Using a camera, depth or other wise, and then applying ML based segmentation to extract the silhouettes/foreground.

Outdoor Far 5M

![Outdoor Far Stereo Zed](Assets/stereoZed/gifs/ZED_outdoor_far.gif "Outdoor Far Stereo Zed")


**notes**

- IR cut filter on sensor, if it was possible to remove it would open up more installation possibilities.
- When testing range outside it only extended 10M not the full 20. 
- Has a 3D scanning application in its SDK.
- Tends to merge the background with foreground, Example: if someone is walking close to a surface the surface distorts around the person.

Outdoor Far 8.3 M

![Outdoor Far Intel RealSense](Assets/IntelRealSense/gifs/realSense_outdoor_far.gif "Outdoor Far Intel RealSense")

**notes**

- Stereo cameras do not have an IR cut filter. So stereo is operational in only IR light.
- Provides good usb support and feedback. It says which usb type it is connected  to and continues to work at a lower quality when its connected to usb 2.0. 
- The 3D view provides dramatically less quality than the 2D view. (see above gifs)  
- Lists 1280x800 as an option, but it will not show any depth when that resolution is set.

Outdoor Narrow mode 3.1M

**notes**

- If it has something in the near field, far field drops/poorly affected. Example: Cannot be sitting in middle of table with table in view, needs to be on the edge of the table
- Provides significantly better range in the "binded" mode.
- The reported range is much smaller than what we observed in testing. In NFOV mode indoors it extended up to 11 meters, but the [specs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/Kinect-dk/hardware-specification) only report a range up to 5.46 meters in NFOV mode.
