# Silhouette Segmentation Approaches

The following is a practical comparison of various techniques of segmenting silhouettes/the general foreground from the background. It is intended as cursory research to inform which approach we use for extracting silhouettes for future installations. We will both compare based off specs/ collected data and share sample footage under various conditions. Important factors include: 

- Cost 
- Silhouette quality 
- multiple device support
- Ability to operate robustly under changing lighting conditions
- Range and FOV 
- Ease of development and Installation 
- Ability to deal with a variety lighting conditions

In general we explored two approaches: 

- Depth Camera: Using a depth camera then setting a 3D region of interest to extract the foreground. 
- Camera + Segmentation: Using a camera, depth or other wise, and then applying ML based segmentation to extract the silhouettes/foreground.

**notes**

- IR cut filter on sensor, if it was possible to remove it would open up more installation possibilities.
- When testing range outside it only extended 10M not the full 20. 
- Has a 3D scanning application in its SDK.
- Tends to merge the background with foreground, Example: if someone is walking close to a surface the surface distorts around the person.

**notes**

- Stereo cameras do not have an IR cut filter. So stereo is operational in only IR light.
- Provides good usb support and feedback. It says which usb type it is connected  to and continues to work at a lower quality when its connected to usb 2.0. 
- The 3D view provides dramatically less quality than the 2D view. (see above gifs)  
- Lists 1280x800 as an option, but it will not show any depth when that resolution is set.

**notes**

- If it has something in the near field, far field drops/poorly affected. Example: Cannot be sitting in middle of table with table in view, needs to be on the edge of the table
- Provides significantly better range in the "binded" mode.
- The reported range is much smaller than what we observed in testing. In NFOV mode indoors it extended up to 11 meters, but the [specs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/Kinect-dk/hardware-specification) only report a range up to 5.46 meters in NFOV mode.

**notes**

- Discontinued support 
- A lot of harware accessories
- plug and play installation 

## Camera + Segmentation   

Overall the advantage of this technique is that it cuts out the work of manually cutting out the background through a region of interest and provides potentially useful additional information like the 3D skeleton, unique IDs for each person in the scene. It will also only mask people and will ignore all other backround objects. The disadvantages include: limited ranges, inability to track from certain angles, higher required specs to perform well.

**notes**

- They threshold the depth data at 4M in the example. Is it possible to increase that threshold through their API?  
- As of writing, there is no support for [multiple sensors](https://community.nuitrack.com/t/adding-multiple-cameras-to-nuitrack/991/11).

Angle

**notes**

- Tracking range and persistence is impressive.
- Less false skeletons than earlier kinect.
- Example only available in NFOV mode and not available in wide mode. Tracking range would decrease in wide mode. 
- While the skeleton information is robust the silhouette segmentation is patchy.
- Requires high specs to run the tracking sdk.

**notes**

- Ran test on macBook pro (2.3 GHz, 16GB of Ram, and NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M) and on a windows tower (3.6 GHz, 16GB of Ram, Quadro P4000). Gifs are from windows tower at 30fps on the macbook they were running at 10 fps and below. 

## Other Possibilities  

This isn't an exhaustive list. Here are some of the other promising possibilities.

- [OpenCV BackgroundSubtractorMOG](https://docs.opencv.org/3.3.0/db/d5c/tutorial_py_bg_subtraction.html) - traditional rgb camera with no ML. Requires calibration when the scene changes. 
- [foreground extraction - FgSegNet_v2](https://github.com/lim-anggun/FgSegNet_v2) - ML approach with an RGB camera. Would need high specs for a good fps and resolution.
- [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark/issues/42) - ML approach on RGB camera. Only masks and not labels would be necessary. Looks like it has a max of 10 fps for realtime performance. 
- [VideoPose3D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/VideoPose3D) - Doesn't provide silhouettes and not intended for realtime. 
- [arkit IOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arbody2d) - Only available in IOS
- [Detectron realtime](https://github.com/cedrickchee/realtime-detectron) - FPS is still low for realtime
